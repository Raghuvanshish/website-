                Data Science and Artificial Intelligence (DS&AI) has emerged as a thriving field from industry utility and employability point of view.Companies are getting increasingly reliant on data backed intelligence and are eager to hire data professionals who can make sense of the information their respective businesses collect day in and day out. Data science is an nascent inter-disciplinary field that uses scientific methods, processes, algorithms and systems to extract knowledge and insights from both structured and unstructured data. The discipline of artificial intelligence involves in integrating knowledge into programs that can handle data and solve complex problems in the way human being thinks and approaches the problem. In today’s context, the expertise in the domains of data science and artificial intelligence is in great demand. Lot of opportunities exists in these emerging domains.Keeping in view these latest trends, Himachal Pradesh University, Shimla has taken active steps to create a new <b>Department of Data Science and Artificial Intelligence</b> under the faculty of physical Science, at University Campus and start a 2 Years Post Graduate Program, M.Sc. in Data Science & Artificial Intelligence,from academic session 2021-22.This course aims to provide aknowledge to the scientific approaches and to the quantitative analysis of industry-scale data using the methods from a wide variety of disciplines including statistics, mathematics, algorithmic, optimization, machine learning, and artificial intelligence.To be recognized globally for excellence in education, research and innovation, and nurture future leaders, to serve the society at large. As we move forward to transform the vision into reality, we will create endless opportunities to students, researchers, faculty and staff in the coming years. I welcome all of you to join the Department of Data Science & Artificial Intelligence and its exciting journey to become a <b>“Network of Excellence”</b>.</p></div>
